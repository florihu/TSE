Can a global predictive geospatial machine learning framework model the spatially explicit
stocks and transaction coefficients of waste producing processes in Copper, Nickel, and Zinc
mining operations?

# Abstract
The escalating demand for critical minerals such as copper, nickel, and zinc, driven by the global en-
ergy transition, underscores the necessity for efficient and scalable methodologies to assess mining-related
waste generation. This study presents a global predictive geospatial machine learning framework designed
to model spatially explicit stocks and transaction coefficients of mine wastes, including waste rock and
tailings. By leveraging geospatial covariates and advanced machine learning algorithms, this research ad-
dresses significant challenges related to data availability, heterogeneity, and methodological consistency.
The framework integrates process modeling approaches with geospatial data analysis, machine learning
techniques, and uncertainty analysis to establish a robust predictive system compatible with Life Cycle
Inventory (LCI) and Input-Output (IO) methodologies. The results of this study are expected to in-
crease the accuracy of both models and enables environmental decision making at unrepresented scale
and resolution.
